Stack : A stack is a linear data structure that can hold many elements.
we refer to a collection of elements that follow a specific order for adding and removing items. 
This order is known as “Last In, First Out” (LIFO).

Basic operations we can do on a stack are:
1. Push: Adds a new element on the top of stack.
2. Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
3. Peek: Returns the top element on the stack without removing it.
4. isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty. Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
5. Size: Finds the number of elements in the stack. 

When Would You Use a Stack?

1. Managing Functions:
 JavaScript uses a stack to keep track of functions. When a function is called, it goes on the stack. When it’s done, it comes off.

2. Undo Buttons: 
Like in a text editor, where you can undo your last actions.

3. Solving Puzzles: 
Some puzzles can be solved using stacks.
