Two type of Searching.

1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search

Linear Search: The Linear Search algorithm searches through an array and 
                returns the index of the value it searches for.


How it works:

1. Go through the array value by value from the start.
2. Compare each value to check if it is equal to the value we are looking for.
3. If the value is found, return the index of that value.
4. If the end of the array is reached and the value is not found, return -1 to indicate that the value was not found.

def linearSearch(arr, targetVal):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == targetVal:
            return i
    return -1

arr = [3, 7, 2, 9, 5]
targetVal = 9

result = linearSearch(arr, targetVal)

if result != -1:
    print("Value",targetVal,"found at index",result)
else:
    print("Value",targetVal,"not found")


This means that time complexity for Linear Search is O(n)

Binary Search: The Binary Search algorithm searches through an array and 
               returns the index of the value it searches for.

Binary Search is much faster than Linear Search, but requires a sorted array to work.

How it works:

1. Check the value in the center of the array.
2. If the target value is lower, search the left half of the array. If the target value is higher, search the right half.
3. Continue step 1 and 2 for the new reduced part of the array until the target value is found or until the search area is empty.
4. If the value is found, return the target value index. If the target value is not found, return -1.

def binarySearch(arr, targetVal):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == targetVal:
            return mid
        
        if arr[mid] < targetVal:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return -1

myArray = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
myTarget = 15

result = binarySearch(myArray, myTarget)

if result != -1:
    print("Value",myTarget,"found at index", result)
else:
    print("Target not found in array.")

Time complexity for Binary Search is O(log2n)
