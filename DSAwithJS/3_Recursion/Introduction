Recursion : 
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly to solve a problem.

There are three basic parts:
1. The Function Declaration
2. The Base Case
3. The Recursive Call command.

Types of Recursions: 
Recursion are mainly of two types depending on whether a function calls itself from within itself or more than one function call one another mutually. 
1. Direct Recursion
2. Indirect Recursion
