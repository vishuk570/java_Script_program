Data Structure: way to organize data so that we can use this data efficently.
eg. [8,2,0,1,3,9,5,6,7,4] => [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]


Algorithm: Steps and process to arrange data

types of data structure: 2 type 
1. primitive data structure : integer,float,character,pointer,boolean
2. non-primitive data structure : Array , List , files


List: 2 types 
1. Linear List : stack and queues
2. Non-Linear List : graphs and tree
