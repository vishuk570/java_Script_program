<!-- Can you describe your experience with React Native? -->

I have over three years of experience in React Native, 
during which I’ve developed and maintained several mobile applications 
for both Android and iOS platforms. 
My experience spans across various domains, including logistics, event management, 
video streaming, training, and financial services.

For example, I recently working on a project called Dapit Residual Reports,
which is a mobile application designed for agents who sell credit and debit cards. 
I am responsible for the full-cycle development of the app,  including designing the user interface, 
integrating Google Sign-In and Microsoft Sign-In, and implementing features 
that allowed users to view and download reports.

Another significant project was I worked on a logistics tracking app called Gemini Tracker. 
In this project, I was responsible for implementing real-time background location tracking
and ensuring the app's stability during critical library upgrades. 
This required deep knowledge of React Native's capabilities, third-party integrations, 
and performance optimization techniques.

Throughout my career, I’ve become proficient in various React Native technologies such as Redux, 
React Navigation, and native modules for both Android and iOS. 
I’m also experienced in debugging, testing, and optimizing apps to ensure they perform efficiently
and provide a seamless user experience.

My experience with React Native has allowed me to tackle a wide range of challenges, 
from creating complex UI components to integrating backend services, 
and I’m always eager to apply these skills to new and innovative projects."

<!-- How do you handle tight deadlines and pressure? -->

I handle tight deadlines and pressure by staying organized, focused, and adaptable.
When faced with a tight deadline, I first break down the project into manageable tasks 
and prioritize them based on urgency and importance. 
I set clear milestones and ensure regular progress checks to stay on track.

<!-- Can you describe a challenging project and how you managed it? -->


Situation:
In one of my recent projects, I was tasked with developing a logistics tracking app, Gemini Tracker,
for truck drivers transferring oil and water between locations. 
The challenge arose when we had to implement a real-time background location tracking feature
that worked seamlessly even in areas with poor network connectivity. 
This feature was critical for ensuring the accurate monitoring of drivers' movements,
which was essential for the client's operations.

Task:
My responsibility was to ensure the background location service was robust and reliable,
even under challenging conditions. Additionally, we needed to upgrade several libraries,
including React Native, without disrupting the app's performance.

Action:
To address this, I broke down the project into smaller tasks, 
starting with researching best practices for implementing background location tracking in React Native.
I collaborated closely with the backend team to ensure the API integration supported real-time updates.
I also implemented a "stun mode" (offline mode) that allowed the app to store location
data locally when the network was unavailable, and then sync it once the connection was restored.

I conducted extensive testing in various environments to ensure reliability and worked on optimizing
the app's performance during the library upgrades. Throughout the project, 
I maintained open communication with the client to manage expectations and provide updates on progress.

Result:
The project was successfully completed within the deadline, and the client was extremely satisfied
with the performance of the background location feature. The app's stability improved significantly
after the upgrades, and it became a key tool for the client’s logistics operations. 
This project was a valuable learning experience in managing technical challenges and delivering
a high-quality solution under pressure.
