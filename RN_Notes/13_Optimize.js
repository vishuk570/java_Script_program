// Optimizing a React Native application is crucial for delivering a smooth, responsive, 
// and efficient user experience.

// 1. Minimize Re-renders
// Use React.memo: Wrap components with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed.
// Avoid Inline Functions/Objects: Passing inline functions or objects as props can trigger re-renders. 
// Instead, define them outside the render method or use useCallback and useMemo.
// Use PureComponent or shouldComponentUpdate: If you are using class components, PureComponent or implementing
// shouldComponentUpdate can help prevent unnecessary renders.


// 2. Optimize State Management
// Minimize State in Components: Keep component state as minimal as possible. Moving state up to a common parent
// or using global state management (like Redux or Context API) where appropriate can help.
// Avoid Deep Component Trees: Flatten your component structure to avoid deep nesting, which can lead to
// excessive re-renders.


// 3. Efficient Image Handling
// Use Proper Image Formats: Use compressed images and appropriate formats 
// (e.g., JPEG for photos, PNG for images with transparency).
// Cache Images: Use libraries like react-native-fast-image for efficient image caching.
// Lazy Load Images: Load images only when they are needed or when they come into view using libraries
// like react-native-lazy-load or by implementing custom logic.


// 4. Reduce JavaScript Thread Load
// Debounce and Throttle: Use debounce or throttle to limit the frequency of function calls like those
// triggered by scroll or resize events.
// Offload Heavy Tasks: Move heavy tasks off the JavaScript thread using InteractionManager, 
// requestAnimationFrame, or by delegating tasks to native modules.


// 5. Use FlatList and VirtualizedList
// Use FlatList for Large Lists: FlatList is more efficient for rendering large lists as it only renders
// items that are currently visible. Avoid using ScrollView for large lists.
// Optimize FlatList and SectionList: Use properties like initialNumToRender, maxToRenderPerBatch, windowSize,
// and removeClippedSubviews to optimize list rendering.


// 6. Avoid Memory Leaks
// Clear Timers and Subscriptions: Ensure that timers, intervals, and event listeners are properly cleared
// in componentWillUnmount or equivalent cleanup functions in hooks.
// Use useEffect Cleanup: In functional components, return a cleanup function in useEffect to handle unmounting
// logic.

// How to find memory link in react native that which screen getting memory leak ?
// To identify memory leaks in React Native, tools like Flipper, React DevTools, and 
// native profiling tools such as Android Studio Profiler and Xcode Instruments are invaluable.
// Monitoring memory usage and ensuring proper cleanup of event listeners and timers can help
// prevent and fix memory leaks.


// 7. Optimize Animations
// Use Native Driver: Use the useNativeDriver option with Animated for smoother animations that run
// on the native thread, reducing the load on the JavaScript thread.
// Limit Complex Animations: Avoid complex animations that require frequent re-renders or heavy computation
// on the JavaScript thread.


// 8. Reduce Bundle Size
// Optimize Imports: Avoid importing entire libraries when only specific functions or components are needed
// (e.g., import { View } from 'react-native' instead of import * as ReactNative from 'react-native').
// Use Code Splitting: Implement lazy loading for screens and components that are not immediately needed.
// Remove Unused Code: Use tools like babel-plugin-transform-remove-console to remove console.log statements
// from the production bundle.


// 9. Use Hermes Engine
// Enable Hermes: Hermes is a JavaScript engine optimized for React Native. It can reduce app start-up time,
// improve performance, and decrease memory usage.
// Optimize for Hermes: Ensure your app is compatible with Hermes and take advantage of its performance benefits.


// 10. Profile and Monitor Performance
// Use React Native Performance Monitor: Enable the performance monitor (Cmd+D on iOS, Cmd+M on Android)
// to track FPS, memory usage, and other performance metrics.
// Use Flipper: Flipper is a platform for debugging and analyzing your React Native apps. It includes tools
// for monitoring app performance, logging, inspecting network requests, and more.
// Profile with Xcode/Android Studio: Use native profilers in Xcode and Android Studio to monitor CPU, GPU,
// memory usage, and to identify bottlenecks in native modules.


// 11. Optimize Network Requests
// Reduce the Number of Requests: Minimize the number of network requests made by your app, combining
// requests where possible.
// Cache Responses: Use libraries like react-query or axios-cache-adapter to cache API responses and
// reduce unnecessary network traffic.
// Use Efficient Data Formats: Consider using efficient data formats like protobufs or compressed JSON
// to reduce the size of data transmitted over the network.


// 12. Leverage Native Modules
// Offload Heavy Tasks to Native Code: For computationally expensive tasks, consider writing native modules
// in Java or Swift/Objective-C. Native code often runs faster than JavaScript.

// 13. Minimize the Number of Dependencies
// Review External Libraries: Regularly audit the libraries your app depends on. Remove unused or outdated
// libraries to reduce bundle size and potential performance issues.
// Use Lightweight Alternatives: Where possible, use lightweight alternatives to large libraries.
// For example, consider using native animations instead of a heavy third-party animation library.

// By applying these optimization techniques, you can significantly improve the performance, responsiveness,
// and overall user experience of your React Native application.
