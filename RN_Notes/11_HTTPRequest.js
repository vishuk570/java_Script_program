// both "fetch" and "axios" are popular choices for making HTTP requests. 

// Fetch API:
// The fetch API is natively available in JavaScript, so thereâ€™s no need to install any external libraries.
// Fetch uses Promises, which makes it easy to handle asynchronous requests.


// Axios:
// Axios has a lot of built-in features like automatic JSON transformation, request/response interceptors,
// and the ability to cancel requests.

// Axios simplifies common tasks like sending JSON data and handling request headers, 
// making the code more concise and readable.



// Conclusion:
// Use "fetch" if you prefer a native, lightweight solution for simple API requests.

// Use "axios" if you need more advanced features, better error handling, and more readable code, 
// especially in complex or large-scale React Native projects.
