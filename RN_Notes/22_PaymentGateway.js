// General Steps for Payment Gateway Integration in React Native

// 1. Choose a Payment Gateway :
// Stripe: Widely used and developer-friendly.
// PayPal: Popular for international payments.
// Razorpay: Popular in India.


// 2. Set Up an Account with the Payment Gateway :
// Obtain the necessary API keys (public and secret keys) from the gatewayâ€™s dashboard.


// 3. Install the Payment Gateway SDK in React Native
// Stripe: @stripe/stripe-react-native
// Razorpay: react-native-razorpay


// 4. Configure Native Modules (if required)


// 5. Implement Payment Logic in React Native

// Create a payment screen in your React Native app where users can initiate payments.
// Use the SDK to handle payments


// 6. Handle Payment Responses

// After the payment process, handle the responses accordingly.
// For successful payments, you may want to store transaction details in your database and show a confirmation to the user.
// For failed payments, handle retries or provide error feedback to the user.


// 7. Test the Payment Flow
// Test various scenarios like successful payments, failed payments, and edge cases.


// 8. Deploy the App
